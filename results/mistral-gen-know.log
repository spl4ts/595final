The main difference lies in the actions taken with the hammer and the trunk. In Story A, Tom is sawing with an unspecified object from the box, and the trunk is loaded without any mention of it being nailed. In Story B, Tom hammers a nail into the trunk. However, since the stories do not provide specific details about the state of the objects before Tom's actions, it is more plausible that Tom could have been sawing with an unspecified object (as in Story A) or could have hammered a nail into the trunk (as in Story B) without any conflict in the given information.\n\nFor Story B, there is no conflicting pair of sentences as all actions are plausible given the context.\n\nFor Story A, there is a potential conflict between sentences 3 and 4, as it is not clear whether the object Tom is sawing with is the same as the trunk he loads into the car. However, since the stories do not provide specific details about the object Tom is sawing, this conflict is not definitive. Therefore, the response for Task 2 would be '%%%% 3, 4'."}]
