The table in Mary\'s dad\'s office contains a pile of stuff. The pile of stuff has been disturbed, and the following items are now on the table: a magazine, a notebook, scissors, and tape.\n\n3. The magazine has been cut out, and the pictures from the magazine are now in the notebook. The pictures are arranged into four collages.\n\n4. The phone rang, and Mary answered it. She was able to chat while she finished up her collages because she was able to put the scissors and tape down momentarily. \n\n5. This is NOT possible. The artwork is still in the notebook, and there is no all-in-one printer in Mary\'s dad\'s office.\n\n6. This is NOT possible. There is no stapler in Mary\'s dad\'s office, and even if there was, the stapler would not be able to staple together three sets of four pages each because the pages are stuck together with tape.\n\n7. This is NOT possible. Mary\'s dad\'s office does not have a laptop, and even if it did, the laptop would not be able to send emails to multiple people at once.\n        Story B: Analysis:\n\n1. The chair is pulled up to the table in Mary\'s dad\'s office. \n\n2. The table in Mary\'s dad\'s office contains a pile of stuff, which now includes a magazine, notebook, scissors, and tape. \n\n3. The magazine has cut-out pictures, and the notebook has four collages made from the pictures. The scissors and tape are present but have been used. \n\n4. The phone rang and was answered. The collages are finished. \n\n5. The collages are no longer present on the table. They have been thrown away. \n\n6. The notebook now contains three sets of four pages each, stapled together, with the top page of each set having "Mary\'s Art" drawn on it with a pen. However, this action is contradictory to the previous action where Mary threw away her collages. The correct interpretation is that Mary stapled together the three sets of four pages each, but did not draw "Mary\'s Art" on the top page. She probably had the top page blank.\n\n7.

However, this does not make the entire story implausible because it's possible that Tom cooked the eggs earlier when the stove was on. \n\nStory B is also coherent and consistent. It states that the stove is turned on, which allows Tom to cook eggs in the pan as stated in sentence 3. The eggs are likely to be cooked and eaten, which is consistent with sentence 4. \n\nHowever, considering the context of cooking and eating, Story A is more plausible because it leaves room for the possibility that Tom cooked the eggs earlier, while Story B implies that Tom cooked and ate the eggs at the same time.\n\n#### 0\n\n## TASK 2\nFor Story A:\nThe conflicting pairs of sentences are:\n%%%% 2, 5 %%%% 3, 1 %%%% 4, 1 %%%% 4, 3\n\nFor Story B:\nThe conflicting pairs of sentences are:\n%%%% 2, 5 %%%% 4, 3"}]

The cabinet is present and John is reaching into it.\n\n3. The soap bar is present and John has grabbed it.\n\n4. This is NOT possible. Bleach and water would have reacted, resulting in a strong chemical reaction and possibly releasing toxic fumes. The floor would not be safe for John to step on. \n\n5. This is NOT possible. John stepped in the bleach, which would have caused his socks to get wet.\n        Story B: Analysis:\n\n1. The bathtub exists and is blue. It is located in John's bathroom.\n\n2. The cabinet is present. John is reaching into it, implying that the cabinet is accessible and items are stored inside.\n\n3. The soap bar is present. It is located in the cabinet and John has retrieved it.\n\n4. This is NOT possible. If John spilled an open container of bleach onto the floor, he would likely have gotten bleach on his skin or shoes, not just stepped in it. Additionally, stepping in bleach would not be a safe or likely action for John to take. \n\n5. This is plausible.
