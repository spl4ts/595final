        If Story A is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story, include '#### 0' in the final line of your response. 
        If Story B is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story, include '#### 1' in the final line of your response.

        ## TASK 2
        For the story that is NOT PLAUSIBLE, identify ALL conflicting pairs of sentences.
        i, j, k are integers representing sentence numbers.
        If sentence i and j are conflicting, include '%%%% i, j' in the final line of your response, e.g. '%%%% 2, 5'
        If sentence i is in conflict with both sentence j and k, include '%%%% j, i %%%% k, i' in the final line of your response, e.g. '%%%% 1, 5 %%%% 2, 5'.
        Ensure that in a pair, the smaller integer is placed in front.

        ## Task 1

**Answer:** #### 0

Story A is more plausible because it follows a logical sequence of events in the order that they occur. The eggs are cracked, beaten, and then used to bake a cake. The use of the egg beater is also appropriate for the task of beating the eggs.

## Task 2

**Answer:**

The story that is not plausible is Story B. The conflicting pairs of sentences are:

**1. %%%% 2, 5**
The eggs are cracked and put in the bowl (sentence 2) and the eggs are eaten (sentence 5).

        Given the following two stories, identify which is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story. 
        If Story A is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story, include '#### 0' in the final line of your response. 
        If Story B is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story, include '#### 1' in the final line of your response.

        ## TASK 2
        For the story that is NOT PLAUSIBLE, identify ALL conflicting pairs of sentences.
        i, j, k are integers representing sentence numbers.
        If sentence i and j are conflicting, include '%%%% i, j' in the final line of your response, e.g. '%%%% 2, 5'
        If sentence i is in conflict with both sentence j and k, include '%%%% j, i %%%% k, i' in the final line of your response, e.g. '%%%% 1, 5 %%%% 2, 5'.
        Ensure that in a pair, the smaller integer is placed in front.
    
        Story A: 1. John entered the bathtub to take a bath.
2. John dropped the soap bar in the bathtub.
3. John accidentally shattered the mirror when retrieving the soap.
4. John got out of the bathtub and dried his hair with the hair dryer.
5. John used the mirror to make sure his face was clean.

        Story B: 1. John entered the bathtub to take a bath.

**Answer:** #### 0

Story A is more plausible because it follows a more logical sequence of events, while Story B includes an additional step of baking the cake, which is not necessary for the story.

**Answer:**

The cake was not baked in Story A, therefore there are no conflicting pairs of sentences.

        ## TASK 1
        Given the following two stories, identify which is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story. 
        If Story A is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story, include '#### 0' in the final line of your response. 
        If Story B is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story, include '#### 1' in the final line of your response.

        ## TASK 2
        For the story that is NOT PLAUSIBLE, identify ALL conflicting pairs of sentences.
        i, j, k are integers representing sentence numbers.
        If sentence i and j are conflicting, include '%%%% i, j' in the final line of your response, e.g. '%%%% 2, 5'
        If sentence i is in conflict with both sentence j and k, include '%%%% j, i %%%% k, i' in the final line of your response, e.g. '%%%% 1, 5 %%%% 2, 5'.
        Ensure that in a pair, the smaller integer is placed in front.

        ## TASK 1
        Given the following two stories, identify which is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story. 
        If Story A is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story, include '#### 0' in the final line of your response. 
        If Story B is the MORE PLAUSIBLE story, include '#### 1' in the final line of your response.

        ## TASK 2
        For the story that is NOT PLAUSIBLE, identify ALL conflicting pairs of sentences.
        i, j, k are integers representing sentence numbers.
        If sentence i and j are conflicting, include '%%%% i, j' in the final line of your response, e.g. '%%%% 2, 5'
        If sentence i is in conflict with both sentence j and k, include '%%%% j, i %%%% k, i' in the final line of your response, e.g. '%%%% 1, 5 %%%% 2, 5'.
        Ensure that in a pair, the smaller integer is placed in front.
    
        Story A: 1. Ann used all the soap bar during her shower.
2. Ann turned on the faucet.
3. Ann mixes detergent in the water.
4. Ann takes a soap bar.
5. Ann cleans her skirt and pants.

        Story B: 1. Ann dried her hair using hair dryer.
2. Ann turned on the faucet.
3. Ann mixes detergent in the water.
4. Ann takes a soap bar.
5. Ann cleans her skirt and pants.<end_of_turn>

        ## Task 1

**Story A is the more plausible story.**

#### 0

## Task 2

**The sentences that are in conflict with Story A are:**

**%%%% 2, 4**
**%%%% 3, 4**

This is because the soap bar is used up in sentence 4, so it is not available to be taken in sentence 2. Additionally, the water is turned on in sentence 2, so it is not available to be mixed with detergent in sentence 3.
